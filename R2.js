Q1
It is giving rise to recursive process

Q2
A step refers to a single computation process that the programme runs.


Q3
It takes 5 steps

Q4
It takes a total of 5 spaces (there are 5 deferred operations)

Q5
It takes 3 + 5 * 3 = 18 steps

Q6
It requires 0 space (there is no deferred operation)

Q7
It is giving rise to recursive process

Q8
It takes 3(from fib to fib_iter) + 5 * 3 (in fib_iter) = 18 steps to calculate fib(5)

Q9
It requires 0 space (there is no deferred operation)
